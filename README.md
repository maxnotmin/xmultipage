# Casper (modified) -> GhostTheme 

The default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) modified by Paul Bakker and renamed GhostTheme.
Developed because of the need to display links to static pages in Casper after the release of Ghost 0.4.0.

Demo at my blog: http://paulbakker.com

* Added a mobile safe menu in default.hbs using jPushMenu.js - https://github.com/takien/jPushMenu
* Changed font-weight styles on Post and Blog Title
* Moved Post Meta under Post Title
* Changed DateTime display on Post Meta
* Added Font Awesome 4.03 - https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome
* Used Font Awesome in menu links and social media icons on default.hbs
